## Here we showcase the mathematical rationale of why the spread of the weibull function is defined by both the alpha and beta parameter

Here is it's equation for the spread of a Weibull function: 

$$
\alpha \cdot \left( \left( -log \left(1 - \frac{1 - \lambda - \delta - \gamma}{1 - \gamma - \lambda} \right) \right)^\frac{1}{\beta}-\left(-log\left(1 - \frac{\delta}{1 - \gamma - \lambda}\right)\right) ^ \frac{1}{\beta} \right)
$$


Knowing the guess rate gamma is 0.5 by design and making the assumptions no lapse occurs, we can simplify to: 
$$
\alpha \cdot \left( (-log(2\cdot\delta))^\frac{1}{\beta}-(-log(1 - 2 \cdot\delta)) ^ \frac{1}{\beta}\right)
$$


If we then set the spread defining threshold delta to 5%, we can further simplify the expression: 
$$
\alpha \cdot \left( (-log(0.1))^\frac{1}{\beta}-(-log(0.9)) ^ \frac{1}{\beta}\right)
$$

From these equations, it is easy to see that the spread scales linearly with the threshold parameter alpha. As a consequence, if alpha changes and beta is constant, the spread changes. In some cases, changes in beta do not reflect a change of spread but rather a compensation of the effect of alpha on the spread.
